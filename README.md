6502 Emulator
=============

A rust implementation of a 6502 emulator, specifically for the [W65C02S][1].

### Future Ideas

* [x] All instructions implemented in CPU module
* [x] Assemble and pass functional tests: https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests
* [x] Add GUI with bevy or egui? https://github.com/emilk/egui
  - [ ] Highlights recently modified registers, memory, etc.
  - [ ] Show table of last n reads/writes to memory
* [ ] Run an old game? https://6502disassembly.com/other-va.html
* [ ] Host on GitHub pages
